## Optimized SCSS functions and mixins for fluid sizes.

fluidWidth provides functionalities to create smart and optimized CSS fluid widths based on the viewport width. A dedicated mixin for fluid font size with integrated fallback is provided too. The output of fluidWidth is better than common fluid width solutions as it’s written with client side optimization in mind and provides simpler math for the browser.
